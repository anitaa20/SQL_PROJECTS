# MY SQL PROJECTS
Welcome to my SQL Projects Repository! This repository documents my journey as a beginner in SQL, showcasing various projects and exercises I've completed to improve my database management and manipulation skills.
As someone new to SQL, I've created this repository to track my progress and share my projects with others. Each project here represents a step in my learning process, from basic queries to more complex database operations. I hope this repository can serve as a resource for other beginners and as a portfolio of my growth in SQL.
